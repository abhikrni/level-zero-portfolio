        <p>Before we start deep diving into using variables in Go-lang, we should first understand the fundamental need for why we use variables in the first place.</p>
        <p>
        Lets say you are creating a social media network for all the IPL lovers to share your favorite moments from the Indian
        Premier League. You will sign up users on that platform and each one of them will have their name, age, favorite team,
        favorite player, etc. All of these properties are the data that you will be storing. You can think of computer memory as
        a sequence of boxes that will hold your data.</p>
        <p>
        The properties like name, favorite team, and the favorite player can be stored as text(strings) while age would be a number. This is important to understand because Go is what is called a statically typed language. This means that you first have to declare the data types of the data you want to store into variables. To be continued..
        </p>

        <p>
            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,
            by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of
            Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
            generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the
            Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to
            generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
            injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
