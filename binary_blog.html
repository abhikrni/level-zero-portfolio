        <p>If you've come across this article, you've probably wondered why computers use binary and after some research got an unsatisfying answer of having something to do with 1's and 0's. My hope is to satisfy that curiosity by the end of this article.</p>
        <p>
        As you probably know, binary works with only two digits, 1s, and 0s. But what does that exactly mean? <i>That means you can
        represent any information with the help of only two digits. You can represent decimal digits in binary(explained below).</i></p>
        <P>
        Furthermore, if you map certain alphabets to specific numbers, you can represent them as binary as well. Some of the
        well-known examples of this notation would ASCII or Unicode. Even our audio/video files are also binary data.</P>
        Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different typefaces and layouts, and in general the content of
        dummy text is nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts, non-readability is of great importance:
        human perception is tuned to recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If the distribution of letters and
        'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and
        readability of the typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page (layout or type area). For this
        reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or less random series of words or syllables. This prevents repetitive
        patterns from impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates the comparison of different typefaces.
        Furthermore, it is advantageous when the dummy text is relatively realistic so that the layout impression of the final
        publication is not compromised.
